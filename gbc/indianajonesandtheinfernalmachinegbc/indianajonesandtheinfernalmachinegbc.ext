Better get out of here before Volodnikov shows up.\Innnddeee!!!\Welcome to my little hothouse!\Sophia! What are you doing here?\I followed the Russians. They've set up a base here while Volodnikov finds a way to get past the Lava Guardian and steal Azerim's Part.\Sophia, we have to get moving.\Thank you Indy, you saved my life.\I'll let you through. Get moving!\Good luck Indy!\About time you showed up Jones. I was getting worried.\Yeah? Me too...\Listen, the Russians are leaving Palawan. Apparently Volodnikov got word about ancient machinery hidden in the Temple of the Sun: Teotihuacan.\#1094
