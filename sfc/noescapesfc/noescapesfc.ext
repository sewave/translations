This makes a highly nasty   trap. Especially for people with no form of footwear,   like the Mole Men.          Well...with these you'd     certainly be in a position  to cut up sheets of metal   (or even to cut pipes).     A fine tool that can cut    through various thicknesses of wire, rope and even      compressed air hoses.       That would hurt someone     badly if it landed on top ofthem. That would be a shame unless it were an Outsider! I cannot think of one singleconstructive use I could putthis to! Can you?
