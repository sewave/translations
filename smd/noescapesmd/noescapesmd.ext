Mr. Robbins, this item is   absolutely crucial to the   survival of this community. I must have it at any cost. It's rough and ready...but  this provides first-aid     treatment if you injure     yourself out in the jungle. Powerful weapons are few andfar between on this island, but this is probably one of the best you could have.    This is almost exactly like the bolt that I removed fromyour leg after your run-in  with the Outsiders.         Marek seized control over   all the Outsiders with this weapon. A shot from this    could take out a dozen men. By using this, a person     would be able to escape thisforsaken island.                                        }#784#784

Sr. Robbins, este objeto es 
absolutamente crucial para

Las armas poderosas son     
escasas en esta isla, pero  
probablemente sea una de las
mejores que puedas tener.   
Esto es casi idéntico al    
tornillo que extraje de tu  
pierna después de tu

Outsiders con este arma. Un 
disparo podría acabar con   
una docena de hombres.

esta isla olvidada.

A V8     engine, I'm not mistaken.                               These are very handy if you have plans to repair or makesomething wooden.                                       This needs to be filled withparaffin or some other      similar natural gas.                                    This would be just the thingto refuel a butane powered  lamp or a portable cooking  stove.                      Ouch! I don't fancy getting a load of that on my head. Ithink it'd probably knock mecold!                       These are strong, springy   and, when released from     tension, they whip out at   great speed.                To make a poisoned dart     launcher with these you needto drill holes for them to  fire from.                  #896
