;00070000{This article should be used for communal gain - not for selfish reasons. The villagecomes first.                Mr. Robbins, this item is   absolutely crucial to the   survival of this community. I must have it at any cost. It's rough and ready...but  this provides first-aid     treatment if you injure     yourself out in the jungle. Powerful weapons are few andfar between on this island, but this is probably one of the best you could have.    This is almost exactly like the bolt that I removed fromyour leg after your run-in  with the Outsiders.         Marek seized control over   all the Outsiders with this weapon. A shot from this    could take out a dozen men. By using this, a person     would be able to escape thisforsaken island.                                        These are very similar to   the type of lights used to  designate emergency landing zones for helicopters.      You would need this if you  were planning to escape fromAbsolom in some sort of     boat.                       Most of our village is builtfrom wood, and our huts are always in need of upkeep andrepair.                     This is ideal for           exploration during the      night, and it's a lot safer than a naked flame too.     Well... this is no surgical instrument but it is pretty sharp and a good knife has  many uses in the jungle.    That's a climbing rope, Mr. Robbins. I'd look for a     grappling hook if I were    you.                        Well, this really does beg aclimbing rope of some sort, doesn't it?                                             For many centuries, in many civilizations, mud has been used for its many medicinal properties.                 This is really of little usewithout a compass to        determine your current      position.                   I know I'm not generally onefor festivities but I reallyfeel like having a barbecue,what do you think?          Wood is plentiful here, yet there is always need for    more. This type is used by  Tree Dwellers in traps.     Poles such as these make forexcellent traps like those  made by the Mole Men.                                   These tools have many uses. One of them is very         definitely to cut through   metal pipes.                With these and a crowbar it would be possible to open a set of inoperational        elevator doors.             Well, I can't imagine using this to defend our communityfrom the Outsiders!                                     Robbins, this information   from the Outsiders is very  important. I'll give you    anything I have for it.     It always pays to know how  to patch yourself up. These will help you survive in theisland environment.         Do you want to go rock      climbing? This is very      useful for reaching those   hard-to-get-to places.      If you are camouflaged, you can often avoid conflict andthen sneak past enemies     unnoticed.                  Some 'body armor' like this under your shirt could      really save your neck in a  tight spot.                 This really is one of the   finest weapons that man has devised in our long history of warfare.                 This is one tough weapon butuseless without ammunition.                                                         This wonderful substance has101 uses! If you don't use  it in specific places it    could be very dangerous.    These are plain,            old-fashioned signaling     lamps. They are used to     attract aerial attention.   This can be very important  in darkened cave areas. But it can also draw attention  to yourself.                Surely you can't tell me    that you don't know what    this is or how to use it?!                              This is, and always has     been, an excellent          camouflage aid.                                         These seem of no consequencebut vegetation can be used  to help you blend in with   the background.             Using this, along with some natural materials, will makea really decent camouflage  net.                        When these are slotted      together they make a surfacethat's tough to penetrate,  even with a crossbow bolt.  This looks very much like a piece of wood that would be ideal to make a weapon like a longbow or a crossbow.    It's unlikely that you couldmake a rifle on Absolom but this could be used to make acrossbow.                   These look like they would  make really fine            arrow-shafts.                                           Naturally this needs to be  used with the Ruger.                                                                If this rather temperamentalliquid is mixed with the    proper clay it becomes a    safer compound - dynamite!  These are obviously used to trigger dynamite explosions.                                                        This lightweight tool is    highly efficient for diggingout foxholes and other      defensive positions.        This shows Absolom and it's relationship to the         mainland. You could use it  to try to escape.           Well, you're a few tools    short of a set with these!                                                          This could be powered by a  generator to make it an     electrified trap.                                       The Tree Dwellers often     suspend piles of junk from  these as traps.                                         Use this to keep sticky and poisonous stuff off your    hands.                                                  This particular item always proves handy in a bar-room  brawl, streetfight or other jungle fracas!              This sort of vegetation is  ideal for making camouflage covers to conceal pits dug  in the ground.              Well, that blowtorch makes  for one handy makeshift     flame-thrower (or for       toasting marshmallows).     Embedded into blocks of     wood, these make for        excellent booby traps.                                  I have no interest in       discussing this item. As youcan see, I'm a very busy    man, Mr. Robbins!           We need to know when the    next Outsider attack is     planned. What would you likefor this information?       This is a very primitive    bomb and I've had more than enough of bombs in my time!                             This is no use without any  ammunition. A crossbow is   just a lump of wood with    nothing to fire from it.    What you have here is a     device with which you could call a Leviticus helicopter to the island.              Nature's very own epoxy!    Tree sap dries very quickly in these weather conditions and is highly adhesive too. Bamboo is very good         structural material that hasmany, many uses.                                        Well, these could hold up   your pants but they could   also be used for binding    things together.            The most natural function ofa bottle is of course to    hold fluids. Might I suggestthat as a use?              This will burn down in a    very short time.                                                                    This looks like a suitable  material for a bowstring,   doesn't it?                                             If these were split down theshaft they would make       excellent flights for arrowsor crossbow bolts.          If you had a piece of soft  material you could repair   this weapon and use it      against the Outsiders.      This material could be used to repair a damaged Ruger.                                                          Don't agitate this! Be      careful. It's so volatile   that changes in temperature can set it off.             I find that a soldering     iron's best use is that for which it was designed for - fixing electronic devices!  Unless I'm mistaken, this isa radio transceiver. Of     course, it lacks the handsetand antenna.                I think that we'd definitelyhave to say that these were part of a radio transceiver.                            Do you have a flashlight    these batteries could be    used in?                                                You could make a covered pitwhich is always handy for   concealing valuables, and   even people, in!            Well, this should really be used in conjunction with a  map of the area. Do you havea map?                      This is a very important    part of an engine. A V8     engine, I'm not mistaken.                               These are very handy if you have plans to repair or makesomething wooden.                                       This needs to be filled withparaffin or some other      similar natural gas.                                    This would be just the thingto refuel a butane powered  lamp or a portable cooking  stove.                      Ouch! I don't fancy getting a load of that on my head. Ithink it'd probably knock mecold!                       These are strong, springy   and, when released from     tension, they whip out at   great speed.                To make a poisoned dart     launcher with these you needto drill holes for them to  fire from.                  This makes a highly nasty   trap. Especially for people with no form of footwear,   like the Mole Men.          Well...with these you'd     certainly be in a position  to cut up sheets of metal   (or even to cut pipes).     A fine tool that can cut    through various thicknesses of wire, rope and even      compressed air hoses.       That would hurt someone     badly if it landed on top ofthem. That would be a shame unless it were an Outsider! I cannot think of one singleconstructive use I could putthis to! Can you?                                       Let's see what those lunaticsavages are up to now! I    will give you something     valuable in return for this.Just make sure to throw the thing before the fuse burns down or it might take your  arm off!                    Ah, I see that you're       looking for a leisurely gameof darts, Mr. Robbins.                                  This is used to clear       blocked tunnels and to get  rid of troublesome          vegetation.                 That'll stick to everything it comes into contact with. Don't get it on your shoes, or you'll get stuck fast!   Are you going to help me    with that plumbing job that I need done? I've got some  blocked pipes back here.    Gasoline has many purposes. Apart from fueling engines, it can also be used as a    cheap and easy explosive.   It looks a bit raggedy and  dirty but I'm sure I could  get a good fire going with  this!                       I don't know about you but  this certainly looks like   some firewood to me!                                    I could use a belt to hold  my pants up. I'm a bit fed  up tying string around my   waist!                      This can be used to store   liquids. If gasoline is put in it, you could make       Molotov cocktails.          If you had suitable string  for this, you could string  it and make a longbow or a  even a crossbow.            At first glance, I'd say it was useless without a rifle barrel but it could be used to make another weapon.     I've no idea what this stuffcould be used for but I havenoticed that it's almost thesame colour as dynamite.    This looks extremely like a telephone to me! Why don't  you reach out and touch     someone?                    This is the stuff that I getas a by-product of gasoline production. It's great for  those paraffin-style lamps. That's the sort of stuff theTechno Warriors hook up to  generators to make those    electrical traps from.      Handy if you're trying to   pick up or scrape off       something that you don't    want to get on your hands.  If the ends of these were   sharpened they'd be ideal   for making spike traps to   use against the Outsiders.  You could certainly repair  piping with these. In fact, you could ruin piping with  them as well.               The crowbar is far and away the single, best tool for   forcing entry into... well, virtually anywhere!         Be careful with those       they're as sharp as knives  and we wouldn't want you    impaling yourself.          I'm sure I know at least oneof my clients who would be  interested in this item.                                The Father will give        anything for information    about the Outsiders' plans! What do you want for this?  If I had that I'd be able toreach salvage that had been lodged in some really       awkward places.             I usually have some         excellent crossbow bolts    that you could use with thatbut I'm fresh out right now.This is probably THE most   valuable item currently on  this island. It's like the  Crown Jewels of Absolom!    Well without the grenade to go with it, it's really justan ornament. It can't be    used without ammunition.    This could be used to escapefrom Absolom, at least it   could if you had access to aboat, that is!              That's a boat anchor, isn't it? It sure looks a lot likean anchor.                                              Netting is useful for       snagging all sorts of       flotsam and jetsam from the ocean, not just for fishing.Sure, I've got a reputation as a salesman but even I'd  have a hard time getting ridof a scrap of dirty cloth!  With my expert eye, I'd say these were chopsticks.      Either that or you could    make crossbow bolts.        Now, if this were working, Icould maybe get something   for it. I wonder if Dysart  has any ideas?              I have some broken          electrical odds and ends    around here that I could    maybe fix up with this.     Gimme a second to take a    look around 'cos I'm sure I had some batteries around   here some place.            You know I could swear that somewhere in here I've got  some bulbs that need        batteries like these.       You know, engine parts      aren't really sought after  around here. There aren't   enough engines.             These would be good to tradeif they were a complete set.It might be worth looking   for the other tools.        Yeeowtch! The Techno        Warriors electrify these as traps in their area of the  island.                     We're on a tropical island, there's wood all over! If   there's one thing we're NOT short of...                 I'm always in the market forcontainers. They always comein handy for holding small  objects and liquids.        These can be used to concealobjects within the          background of the Mole Mens'Tunnels.                    If you need to pry somethingapart this is THE tool for  the job! It can open locks  or doors in a jiffy.        Ugh! This is disgusting! It looks like it's covered in  all sorts of horrible germs and bugs!                   Where did you get this? I   wonder who the spy in the   Outsiders' camp is. Can we  trade for this note?        Well! What very interesting net curtains! I really do   like the jungle motif with  the leaves and mud!         That's very stylish, isn't  it? And I guess it could    probably save your life in  some cases, couldn't it?    Are you planning to put up aset of shelves for me? I    could use some extra storagespace.                      Pee-yew! These are all      greasy and sticky. Just lookat them! All covered with   some kind of smelly oil.    You should take this to     Father. I don't know what heuses gas for, maybe he has acar hidden somewhere?       I like a nice bit of twine! There's nothing like it for tying things up and keeping them neat and tidy.         Yes, I like to collect      feathers to replace the oneson my duster when they wear out.                        This looks dangerous! What  could you use it with? No   one here has a gun.                                     What a rarity on this rock. One has to put up with      sackcloth! This reminds me  of how things are back home.It's mud! It's dirt! Pure   and simple, this is all it  is. Still, I suppose one    could use it as a face pack.Mr. Robbins! You do tend to find some very odd things   indeed!                                                 Is this a TV remote? You    could trade it with the     Techno-Warriors, they could use it for jewelry!         If only we had electricity, we could have some proper   lighting around here insteadof all these torches!       What a pretty trinket! I    wonder if I might keep it   for myself...just a little  precious something.         I don't know much of manual matters but this looks like less than a full set of     tools to my untrained eye.  Well, this isn't much use! Ishould stick to good old    candles! You know where you are with a candle.          It reminds me of those bars in that horrible prison,    Leviticus. Maybe it could beattached to a generator?    That could be used to       protect possessions. The    Techno Warriors like to     electrify fences as traps.  I'm not sure why anyone     would want to but you could hang things from trees on   the ends of these vines.    That looks really heavy! I  imagine I could make quite adecorative doorstop from    some of it.                 These are very springy...anddangerous because of it. I  have some severe welts whereI was last hit by bamboo!   You can store many things injars. In an environment suchas this they're handy for   carrying liquids around.    I don't know much about     traps but I'm sure those areused in Tree Dwellers'      poisoned dart launchers.    That would be very dangerousif you were to stand on it. You would cut your feet to  ribbons, Robbins!           That's a heavy wooden block.I don't know if I could liftit, never mind what would   happen if it fell on me.    ~00~}#17588#17585
This article should be used for communal gain - not for selfish reasons. The villagecomes first.                Mr. Robbins, this item is   absolutely crucial to the   survival of this community. I must have it at any cost. It's rough and ready...but  this provides first-aid     treatment if you injure     yourself out in the jungle. Powerful weapons are few andfar between on this island, but this is probably one of the best you could have.    This is almost exactly like the bolt that I removed fromyour leg after your run-in  with the Outsiders.         Marek seized control over   all the Outsiders with this weapon. A shot from this    could take out a dozen men. By using this, a person     would be able to escape thisforsaken island.                                        These are very similar to   the type of lights used to  designate emergency landing zones for helicopters.      You would need this if you  were planning to escape fromAbsolom in some sort of     boat.                       Most of our village is builtfrom wood, and our huts are always in need of upkeep andrepair.                     This is ideal for           exploration during the      night, and it's a lot safer than a naked flame too.     Well... this is no surgical instrument but it is pretty sharp and a good knife has  many uses in the jungle.    That's a climbing rope, Mr. Robbins. I'd look for a     grappling hook if I were    you.                        Well, this really does beg aclimbing rope of some sort, doesn't it?                                             For many centuries, in many civilizations, mud has been used for its many medicinal properties.                 This is really of little usewithout a compass to        determine your current      position.                   I know I'm not generally onefor festivities but I reallyfeel like having a barbecue,what do you think?          Wood is plentiful here, yet there is always need for    more. This type is used by  Tree Dwellers in traps.     Poles such as these make forexcellent traps like those  made by the Mole Men.                                   These tools have many uses. One of them is very         definitely to cut through   metal pipes.                With these and a crowbar it would be possible to open a set of inoperational        elevator doors.             Well, I can't imagine using this to defend our communityfrom the Outsiders!                                     Robbins, this information   from the Outsiders is very  important. I'll give you    anything I have for it.     It always pays to know how  to patch yourself up. These will help you survive in theisland environment.         Do you want to go rock      climbing? This is very      useful for reaching those   hard-to-get-to places.      If you are camouflaged, you can often avoid conflict andthen sneak past enemies     unnoticed.                  Some 'body armor' like this under your shirt could      really save your neck in a  tight spot.                 This really is one of the   finest weapons that man has devised in our long history of warfare.                 This is one tough weapon butuseless without ammunition.                                                         This wonderful substance has101 uses! If you don't use  it in specific places it    could be very dangerous.    These are plain,            old-fashioned signaling     lamps. They are used to     attract aerial attention.   This can be very important  in darkened cave areas. But it can also draw attention  to yourself.                Surely you can't tell me    that you don't know what    this is or how to use it?!                              This is, and always has     been, an excellent          camouflage aid.                                         These seem of no consequencebut vegetation can be used  to help you blend in with   the background.             Using this, along with some natural materials, will makea really decent camouflage  net.                        When these are slotted      together they make a surfacethat's tough to penetrate,  even with a crossbow bolt.  This looks very much like a piece of wood that would be ideal to make a weapon like a longbow or a crossbow.    It's unlikely that you couldmake a rifle on Absolom but this could be used to make acrossbow.                   These look like they would  make really fine            arrow-shafts.                                           Naturally this needs to be  used with the Ruger.                                                                If this rather temperamentalliquid is mixed with the    proper clay it becomes a    safer compound - dynamite!  These are obviously used to trigger dynamite explosions.                                                        This lightweight tool is    highly efficient for diggingout foxholes and other      defensive positions.        This shows Absolom and it's relationship to the         mainland. You could use it  to try to escape.           Well, you're a few tools    short of a set with these!                                                          This could be powered by a  generator to make it an     electrified trap.                                       The Tree Dwellers often     suspend piles of junk from  these as traps.                                         Use this to keep sticky and poisonous stuff off your    hands.                                                  This particular item always proves handy in a bar-room  brawl, streetfight or other jungle fracas!              This sort of vegetation is  ideal for making camouflage covers to conceal pits dug  in the ground.              Well, that blowtorch makes  for one handy makeshift     flame-thrower (or for       toasting marshmallows).     Embedded into blocks of     wood, these make for        excellent booby traps.                                  I have no interest in       discussing this item. As youcan see, I'm a very busy    man, Mr. Robbins!           We need to know when the    next Outsider attack is     planned. What would you likefor this information?       This is a very primitive    bomb and I've had more than enough of bombs in my time!                             This is no use without any  ammunition. A crossbow is   just a lump of wood with    nothing to fire from it.    What you have here is a     device with which you could call a Leviticus helicopter to the island.              Nature's very own epoxy!    Tree sap dries very quickly in these weather conditions and is highly adhesive too. Bamboo is very good         structural material that hasmany, many uses.                                        Well, these could hold up   your pants but they could   also be used for binding    things together.            The most natural function ofa bottle is of course to    hold fluids. Might I suggestthat as a use?              This will burn down in a    very short time.                                                                    This looks like a suitable  material for a bowstring,   doesn't it?                                             If these were split down theshaft they would make       excellent flights for arrowsor crossbow bolts.          If you had a piece of soft  material you could repair   this weapon and use it      against the Outsiders.      This material could be used to repair a damaged Ruger.                                                          Don't agitate this! Be      careful. It's so volatile   that changes in temperature can set it off.             I find that a soldering     iron's best use is that for which it was designed for - fixing electronic devices!  Unless I'm mistaken, this isa radio transceiver. Of     course, it lacks the handsetand antenna.                I think that we'd definitelyhave to say that these were part of a radio transceiver.                            Do you have a flashlight    these batteries could be    used in?                                                You could make a covered pitwhich is always handy for   concealing valuables, and   even people, in!            Well, this should really be used in conjunction with a  map of the area. Do you havea map?                      This is a very important    part of an engine. A V8     engine, I'm not mistaken.                               These are very handy if you have plans to repair or makesomething wooden.                                       This needs to be filled withparaffin or some other      similar natural gas.                                    This would be just the thingto refuel a butane powered  lamp or a portable cooking  stove.                      Ouch! I don't fancy getting a load of that on my head. Ithink it'd probably knock mecold!                       These are strong, springy   and, when released from     tension, they whip out at   great speed.                To make a poisoned dart     launcher with these you needto drill holes for them to  fire from.                  This makes a highly nasty   trap. Especially for people with no form of footwear,   like the Mole Men.          Well...with these you'd     certainly be in a position  to cut up sheets of metal   (or even to cut pipes).     A fine tool that can cut    through various thicknesses of wire, rope and even      compressed air hoses.       That would hurt someone     badly if it landed on top ofthem. That would be a shame unless it were an Outsider! I cannot think of one singleconstructive use I could putthis to! Can you?                                       Let's see what those lunaticsavages are up to now! I    will give you something     valuable in return for this.Just make sure to throw the thing before the fuse burns down or it might take your  arm off!                    Ah, I see that you're       looking for a leisurely gameof darts, Mr. Robbins.                                  This is used to clear       blocked tunnels and to get  rid of troublesome          vegetation.                 That'll stick to everything it comes into contact with. Don't get it on your shoes, or you'll get stuck fast!   Are you going to help me    with that plumbing job that I need done? I've got some  blocked pipes back here.    Gasoline has many purposes. Apart from fueling engines, it can also be used as a    cheap and easy explosive.   It looks a bit raggedy and  dirty but I'm sure I could  get a good fire going with  this!                       I don't know about you but  this certainly looks like   some firewood to me!                                    I could use a belt to hold  my pants up. I'm a bit fed  up tying string around my   waist!                      This can be used to store   liquids. If gasoline is put in it, you could make       Molotov cocktails.          If you had suitable string  for this, you could string  it and make a longbow or a  even a crossbow.            At first glance, I'd say it was useless without a rifle barrel but it could be used to make another weapon.     I've no idea what this stuffcould be used for but I havenoticed that it's almost thesame colour as dynamite.    This looks extremely like a telephone to me! Why don't  you reach out and touch     someone?                    This is the stuff that I getas a by-product of gasoline production. It's great for  those paraffin-style lamps. That's the sort of stuff theTechno Warriors hook up to  generators to make those    electrical traps from.      Handy if you're trying to   pick up or scrape off       something that you don't    want to get on your hands.  If the ends of these were   sharpened they'd be ideal   for making spike traps to   use against the Outsiders.  You could certainly repair  piping with these. In fact, you could ruin piping with  them as well.               The crowbar is far and away the single, best tool for   forcing entry into... well, virtually anywhere!         Be careful with those       they're as sharp as knives  and we wouldn't want you    impaling yourself.          I'm sure I know at least oneof my clients who would be  interested in this item.                                The Father will give        anything for information    about the Outsiders' plans! What do you want for this?  If I had that I'd be able toreach salvage that had been lodged in some really       awkward places.             I usually have some         excellent crossbow bolts    that you could use with thatbut I'm fresh out right now.This is probably THE most   valuable item currently on  this island. It's like the  Crown Jewels of Absolom!    Well without the grenade to go with it, it's really justan ornament. It can't be    used without ammunition.    This could be used to escapefrom Absolom, at least it   could if you had access to aboat, that is!              That's a boat anchor, isn't it? It sure looks a lot likean anchor.                                              Netting is useful for       snagging all sorts of       flotsam and jetsam from the ocean, not just for fishing.Sure, I've got a reputation as a salesman but even I'd  have a hard time getting ridof a scrap of dirty cloth!  With my expert eye, I'd say these were chopsticks.      Either that or you could    make crossbow bolts.        Now, if this were working, Icould maybe get something   for it. I wonder if Dysart  has any ideas?              I have some broken          electrical odds and ends    around here that I could    maybe fix up with this.     Gimme a second to take a    look around 'cos I'm sure I had some batteries around   here some place.            You know I could swear that somewhere in here I've got  some bulbs that need        batteries like these.       You know, engine parts      aren't really sought after  around here. There aren't   enough engines.             These would be good to tradeif they were a complete set.It might be worth looking   for the other tools.        Yeeowtch! The Techno        Warriors electrify these as traps in their area of the  island.                     We're on a tropical island, there's wood all over! If   there's one thing we're NOT short of...                 I'm always in the market forcontainers. They always comein handy for holding small  objects and liquids.        These can be used to concealobjects within the          background of the Mole Mens'Tunnels.                    If you need to pry somethingapart this is THE tool for  the job! It can open locks  or doors in a jiffy.        Ugh! This is disgusting! It looks like it's covered in  all sorts of horrible germs and bugs!                   Where did you get this? I   wonder who the spy in the   Outsiders' camp is. Can we  trade for this note?        Well! What very interesting net curtains! I really do   like the jungle motif with  the leaves and mud!         That's very stylish, isn't  it? And I guess it could    probably save your life in  some cases, couldn't it?    Are you planning to put up aset of shelves for me? I    could use some extra storagespace.                      Pee-yew! These are all      greasy and sticky. Just lookat them! All covered with   some kind of smelly oil.    You should take this to     Father. I don't know what heuses gas for, maybe he has acar hidden somewhere?       I like a nice bit of twine! There's nothing like it for tying things up and keeping them neat and tidy.         Yes, I like to collect      feathers to replace the oneson my duster when they wear out.                        This looks dangerous! What  could you use it with? No   one here has a gun.                                     What a rarity on this rock. One has to put up with      sackcloth! This reminds me  of how things are back home.It's mud! It's dirt! Pure   and simple, this is all it  is. Still, I suppose one    could use it as a face pack.Mr. Robbins! You do tend to find some very odd things   indeed!                                                 Is this a TV remote? You    could trade it with the     Techno-Warriors, they could use it for jewelry!         If only we had electricity, we could have some proper   lighting around here insteadof all these torches!       What a pretty trinket! I    wonder if I might keep it   for myself...just a little  precious something.         I don't know much of manual matters but this looks like less than a full set of     tools to my untrained eye.  Well, this isn't much use! Ishould stick to good old    candles! You know where you are with a candle.          It reminds me of those bars in that horrible prison,    Leviticus. Maybe it could beattached to a generator?    That could be used to       protect possessions. The    Techno Warriors like to     electrify fences as traps.  I'm not sure why anyone     would want to but you could hang things from trees on   the ends of these vines.    That looks really heavy! I  imagine I could make quite adecorative doorstop from    some of it.                 These are very springy...anddangerous because of it. I  have some severe welts whereI was last hit by bamboo!   You can store many things injars. In an environment suchas this they're handy for   carrying liquids around.    I don't know much about     traps but I'm sure those areused in Tree Dwellers'      poisoned dart launchers.    That would be very dangerousif you were to stand on it. You would cut your feet to  ribbons, Robbins!           That's a heavy wooden block.I don't know if I could liftit, never mind what would   happen if it fell on me.    ~00~#17585
